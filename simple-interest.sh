ðŸŽ¨ Design & Customization Highlights
Zenith's design focuses on modern aesthetics and user comfort. A significant part of its appeal lies in its dynamic and customizable styling:

Global Font: Utilizes the clean and "cozy" Quicksand font throughout the application for consistent readability and a friendly feel.
Themed Palette: Features a harmonious color palette that adapts beautifully between dark and light modes, with distinct neutral text colors and cool-toned accents. The navigation bar, content blocks, and elements like dropdowns are all consistently styled across themes.
Interactive Elements: Subtle hover animations and transitions on buttons, cards, and theme toggles for a responsive and engaging user experience.
Unique Animated Background: The background features 8 distinct, gradient-filled circles that subtly move across the viewport. These circles are non-repeating and are visible through translucent content blocks, creating a vibrant, yet non-distracting, ambiance.
Easily Modifiable CSS: All major design elements are controlled via well-organized CSS variables in the :root and [data-theme="light"] selectors, making it incredibly easy for developers to:
Change primary, secondary, and accent colors.
Adjust background opacity for content blocks and elements.
Modify the animated background's colors, number of circles, sizes, positions, and animation speed.
Customize text shadows, borders, and overall typography.
